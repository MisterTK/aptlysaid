-- SUPABASE MIGRATION: Fix Public Schema - Views and Comments
-- ====================================================================
-- Generated: 2025-09-06
-- Purpose: Add missing views and table comments to public schema
--
-- This migration completes the schema synchronization by adding:
-- - 4 missing views in public schema
-- - 5 missing table comments
